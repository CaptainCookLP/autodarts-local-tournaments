# Autodarts Local Tournaments

This browser extension bundles a small local X01 tournament helper with the live data scraper from [autodarts-scraper](https://github.com/CaptainCookLP/autodarts-scraper).

## Features
- Configure a four-player knockout bracket and automatically apply players and modes when a new X01 lobby opens.
- Scrape scoreboard data on play.autodarts.io with selectable CSS selectors and optional webhook export.
- View the latest scraped JSON directly in the extension.

## Usage
Load this folder as an unpacked extension in your Chromium browser and open the options page to set up the scraper and tournament.
